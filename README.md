 GPA calculator website that can be used by EBHS students to calculate their GPA, includes a final grade calculator

Creators
The East Brunswick Utility Calculator was a project developed by Suday and Brian, two students from East Brunswick. We continuously incorporate updates, so remember to revisit our platform regularly. If you have any questions or recommendations, please feel free to contact Suday at sundayk1525@gmail.com or Brian at hebrian2718@gmail.com.

How the GPA Calculator Works
The GPA Calculator employed on this platform follows the official guidelines outlined in the East Brunswick High School Student Handbook for accurate GPA determination. To access the relevant information, please refer to the Grade Point Average section within the handbook. In this section, you will find two distinct tables: one designated for academic classes (including unweighted GPA) and the other specifically tailored for honors and AP classes. These tables provide grade point values that enable you to effectively compute your GPA. To calculate your GPA, diligently follow these steps:

1) Locate the letter grade assigned to the class you wish to evaluate.
2) Identify the corresponding grade value associated with the aforementioned letter grade.
3) Multiply the grade value by the total credit hours assigned to the respective course.
4) Repeat this process for all your classes.
5) To obtain your final GPA, sum the products obtained in the previous step and divide by the total credit hours accumulated.

By diligently following these steps, you will be able to accurately determine your GPA based on the guidelines established in the East Brunswick High School Student Handbook.
